# Welcome
Intentionally empty. My old adventure in AOSP is showing up as a popular repo so I pinned this repo to make it clean looking. I do a lot of development work in React, Typescript, Javascript, java, and Android Java lately.  Language and platform agnostic developer tuned for fast pace and keeping up with industry.

Architect of IRIS, research and development funded by FCC, a deaf and hard of hearing equivalence solution using IMS. WebRTC, and other.

Work for NTID and on contract to MITRE who oversee my work on IRIS.
